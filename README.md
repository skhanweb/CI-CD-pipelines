# Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment using GitHub Actions

## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is the process in software development practices to automate the building and testing of source code every time a team member pushes changes to version control system. CI encourages developers to share their code and unit tests by integrating their changes into a common version control repository upon finishing each minor task.

### Continuous Deployment

The software development approach known as Continuous Deployment (CD) involves automatically releasing application code updates into the production environment. A set of predefined tests serve as the engine for this automation. The mechanism directly delivers fresh updates to end users once they pass those checks.
